## Testing

### Unit and Widget Tests

To run unit and widget tests, use the following command:

```bash
flutter test
```

### Integration Test

The current integration test scenario requires granting a permission at app startup. To automate this process, you can use a test driver along with `adb` commands to allow the required permission.

Run the integration test with the following command:

```bash
flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test_driver.dart --target=integration_test/app_test.dart
```
